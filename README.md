# Fast Food Restaurant Recommendation in Toronto
## Background
Toronto is the financial capital of Canada, with lots of business opportunities and business friendly environment, it has no issue in attracting many different players into the market. However, that also means the market is highly competitive and as a well-developed city, the cost of doing business is also one of the highest in the country. And thus, any new business venture or expansion in the country needs to be reviewed carefully and strategically targeted so that the return on investment will be sustainably reasonable and more importantly the investment can be considerably less risker.

## Business Problem 
Let say if someone is looking to open a Fast Food Restaurant in Toronto. The main problem/question is where or which is the best neighbourhood to open the restaurant in Toronto city? In order to answer this problem, we have to consider may things such as there must be enough customers, preferences of residents in the relevant neighbourhood etc.

Toronto is one of the most multicultural and multiracial cities in the world. So, there are many ethnic origins live in the toronto city. Thus, we have to match their food preferences in order to make profits. In order to do that we will use clustering to find some similar neighbourhoods and choose the best neighbourhood among them.
