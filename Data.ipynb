Thus we need to scrap an existing Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.\n- We will use the package called beautifulsoup to scape data from the web page(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Toronto_neighbourhoods)\n- We will then need to leverage on features in a reliable location information provider namely [Foursquare](https://www.Foursquare.com) to explore the various types of venues and its categories available in each neighbourhood.\n- Then we will also use unsupervised learning method called clustering technique and use the easiest clustering method namely K-Clustering to segment and cluster these neighbourhoods so that we can group them together to understand their similarities."
